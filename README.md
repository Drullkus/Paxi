# Packie
Minecraft mod for automatic global data pack loading

The first time you run Packie, the `packie` folder will be created in your Minecraft config directory.
Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play.
Both zip files and regular folders (containing a `pack.mcmeta` file) are supported.

Packie is currently only for snapshot 20w45a. There are no plans to port to other versions at this time.
