# Paxi
Minecraft mod for automatic global data & resource pack loading

The first time you run Paxi, the `paxi` folder will be created in your Minecraft config directory.
Any data packs placed in this folder will be automatically loaded into any world you play.
Both zip files and regular folders (containing a `pack.mcmeta` file) are supported.

See the [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/paxi-fabric) post for supported versions and releases.
